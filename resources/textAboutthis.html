This is the transfer function educational tool.
</h1>

<p>
This open-source education application evaluates transfer function, that determines how each frequency in the input motion is amplified, or deamplified, by the soil deposit. A known time history of input motion is represented as a Fourier series, using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Each term in the Fourier series of the input motion is then multiplied by the transfer function to produce the Fourier series of the output motion. The output motion can then be expressed in the time domain using the inverse FFT.
