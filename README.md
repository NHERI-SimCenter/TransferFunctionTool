# Transfer Function Tool
TFT focuses on the application of the transfer function principle to one dimensional layered soil profiles,
to calculate the output (surface) motion induced by a given input (bedrock) motion.

This educational tool allows users to define layered soil profiles underlain by rigid/elastic rock and change the
characteristics of each layer, including thickness, shear wave velocity, density, and damping ratio of
each layer. The user can also choose from various predefined input (rock) motions or supply specific motions.
By changing the soil profile and input motion, the user can examine how each frequency in the input motion is
amplified, or de-amplified by the soil deposit. Users can then develop a clear understanding of the effect of
soil properties on wave propagation through layered media and its application to site response analysis.
